      <p class="content">
        We here at "Back to the Ride" know that one of the greatest struggles in people's lives nowadays is the commute.
        Whether it be to work, the grocery store, or just a social venue, the road there is often full of tedium, boredom, and waste.
        Driving there yourself is a hassle, and ordering a ride through one of our competitors is often expensive and slow.
        To this end, we sought to introduce a new platform that could meet people's demands for hasty transportation, without sacrificing
        comfort or, most importantly, cost-effectiveness. How do we manage this? DeLoreans, of course! Through the power of time travel, we can
        transport our customers from point A to point B at a staggeringly fast speed, leaping through the fabric of space and time in the blink
        of an eye. Don't worry, all of our vehicles have built-in cup holders. Register today to get back to the ride.
